# Snakes of Singapore Blog (S.S.S)
[https://snake-blog.herokuapp.com/](http://snake-blog.herokuapp.com/)

A digital repository for logging Snake info/profiles in their natural habitats


## Introduction

Logging information on snakes specimen in the midst of thick vegetation can be sticky at times. This blog helps the snake enthusiast to quickly log vital data (pictures, location etc.) and can also serve as a reference for previous sightings.

## Technologies
- NodeJs v14
- HTML/CSS
- Bootstrap v4.1

## Why the need for a snake respository?

Logging animal information can be tedious and difficult, especially so when you are out in their natural habitat looking for them.

With just your mobile browser, you can quickly summon the standard 'submit entry' form which allows you to enter the usual parameters quickly. This includes the photo you took with your cameraphone, and also using Google Map and html geolocation APIs to pinpoint the specimen's location. No more need for heavy logbooks!

## How to Use

You can simply browse through all the snakes that have been logged before. Using existing data, you can narrow your search around the area looking for the snake, or use photos to identify individuals.

You can go one step further by logging information on the snake you just found. Simply use the 'submit entry' form and you can log your data immediately to share with our community!

Should you need to edit or delete(*only if you are the originator), you can do so as well.

All functions are accessible to registered users only.

## Project status

This blog is just starting out, so contributions and entries are welcomed! We hope to build on our snake data as much and as quickly as we can.

## Technical Challenges
- some elements work only on client side (Google Maps)
- figuring out how to use passport strategies 
- color themes and ensuring readability of site

## Improvements to be made
- better use of passport (flash messages, FB login)
- geocoding of location based on street name, zip
- establishing relationships between Collections

## Lessons Learnt
- using new technologies (passport, googlemaps, google login)
- using bootstrap components (carousel, jumbotron, modal)
- prioritising the requirements of the project
- need to understand requirements/difficulty of technologies before using them
