## Snake Blog/Respository

A digital repository for logging Snake info/profiles in their natural habitats


## Story behind the App

- SCUBA diving to see marinelife
- Observed that collated data on marine animals is sparse and unorganized
- focused on snakes for app due to feasibility
- cut down equipment for logging (e.g. logbooks, pen, separate camera, GPS locator)
- just need a mobile

## Features of the App
- CRUD
- Authentication (passport)
- google maps api

## Technical Details
- Authentication (passport)
- google maps api
- how the schemas models interact 
- bootstrap elements


## Technical Challenges
- some elements work only on client side (Google Maps)
- figuring out how to use passport strategies 
- geolocation only works on secured sites (heroku free tier does not have cert)
- color themes and ensuring readability of site

## Improvements to be made
- better use of passport (flash messages, google/FB login)
- geocoding of location based on street name, zip
- establishing relationships between Collections

## Lessons Learnt
- using new technologies (passport, googlemaps)
- using more bootstrap components (carousel, jumbotron, modal)
- prioritising the requirements of the project
- need to understand requirements/difficulty of technologies before using them
